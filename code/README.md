# Code

This directory contains the analysis and curation code necessary for this project. It is organized into three subdirectories, as follows:

- **Databricks**: Code that has been exported from the NHS Digital TRE and broadly covers the data preparation.

- **R**: Code that has been exported from the NHS Digital TRE and broadly covers the data analysis.

- **NonTRE**: Code from outside of the NHS Digital TRE that was used to produce figures and tables for publication.
