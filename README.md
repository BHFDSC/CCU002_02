# SARS-CoV-2 infection and risk of venous thromboembolism and arterial thrombotic events

## Project description

There  have  been  a  number  of  reports  of  vascular  complications  after  coronavirus vaccination.  The complication that is of most concern is a very rare condition of clotting of the veins in unusual places like the brain and the gut which has been associated with low levels of platelets.

We will study all adults alive in England at thebeginning of the pandemic in 2020 with data included in the NHS Digital trusted research environment. We will find out which people had a disease involving blood  clots  in  the  arteries  (like  stroke  or  heart  attack)  or  in  the  veins  (like  deep  vein  thrombosis, pulmonary  embolism  or  clots  in the  veins  of  the  brain  or  gut). We  will also  find  out  which of  these people were diagnosed with low levels of platelets at the time of their blood clotting event.

We will compare the risk of developing one of these conditions among people who have had a Covid-19 vaccine versus those who have not had a vaccine.  We will use statistical methods to account for differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated people (such as age, sex, ethnic group and previous medical  history) that  might  affect  the  risk  of  these  conditions.  We  will  assess  the  risks  for  clotting events of different types, for different vaccines, for people who have had one or two vaccine doses, and for people with different characteristics. Our results will allowus to estimate whether Covid-19 vaccine is associated with an increased risk of one or more of these different types of clotting events, and if so by how much.

This  research  is  needed  to  provide  reliable  information  to  medicines regulators,  the  Department  of Health and Social Care, health professionals and the public about any risks associated with Covid-19 vaccines. Because the clotting events that might be affected are very rare, any increase in risk is likely to  be  very  small.  It  will,  therefore,  be  important  to  understand not  only  whether  or  not  there  is  an increased risk but also the size of any increased risk and whether it only applies to particular groups of people. It will also be important to understand how any risk compares with the protective benefits of the vaccine, which are known to be substantial.
